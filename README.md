# Covid-Screening-Application
This project is a Covid Screening Application where users can register their Covid status and symptoms. If a user registers themselves as having Covid or shows symptoms during the screening, they are flagged. The application also provides options to remove registration, unflag oneself, and print the database stored in a SQL Database.
